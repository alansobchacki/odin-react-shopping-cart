Project: Shopping Cart
=============

A mock-up of a basic e-commerce website.

Here's the [live project demo.](https://odin-react-shopping-cart-three.vercel.app/)

About
-----

This project was completed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) [React](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/react) curriculum. It is the third and final project required for completion of the React Course [3/3].

These were the project requirements:

- [x] Have at least two pages (a home page and a shop page, which includes your shopping cart).
- [x] Let the user navigate between the pages with a navigation bar, which will be shown on both pages.
- [x] To your homepage, you can add whatever youâ€™d like! A few images or information will be totally fine.
- [x] On the shopping cart page, you should have the same navigation bar that displays the number of items currently in the cart.
- [x] You should also have a button next to it where you can go to the cart to checkout and pay (payment logic is not required for this project).
- [x] Build individual card elements for each of your products. Allow the user to increase or decrease how many products they wish to buy.
- [x] Fetch your shop items from FakeStore API or something similar.
- [x] Once a user has submitted their order, the amount on the cart itself should adjust accordingly.
- [x] Style your application as desired.

What I Learned
-----

I learned the basics of react-router-dom library: I've set up routes, used Link and Outlet components, and also toyed with the useNavigate hook. This is my first multi-page React app, so it was a fun project.

Notes
-----

It wasn't a requirement, but I also took the time to make it responsive. And the design layout/UX were all made up on the go.
